# Setup a project from the bootstrap

You will find under the [bootstrap folder]() of this repository a little bootstrap that should save you a couple of hours when start a new project with this stack.

We will improve it over time but for now, it provides at least:
-> a coherent folders and packages organization,
-> the setup of essential libs like react-native-navigation, react-intl, react-redux, redux...
-> a compilable and runnable bootstrap app that you can just edit to start your project

To use this bootstrap, follow these steps:
- copy and paste de bootstrap folder in place of your project folder,
- rename the `myapp` haxe package by whatever package name you'd like,
- follow the setup steps described in the bootsrap [README](site.github.repository_url/bootstrap/README.md}}){:target="_blank"})

You should be up and running.
