# Contributions

Discussions and PRs are welcome (even expected) and can be about just anything that composes the stack: documentation, dependencies, design patterns...

If there is something you'd like to add to the stack, please start a discussion on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/zabojad/haxe-react-native-stack/issues){:target="_blank"}.
