# haxe-react-native-stack

** *An open source tech stack for mobile applications development with Haxe, Redux and React native.* **

This documentation is related to the version 1.0.x of the stack.

## General information

The aim of this repo is to group and version the documentations, samples, training materials of a tech stack for mobile apps development.

This tech stack is subject to constant evolutions, in terms of library dependencies, versionning, documentations and samples, etc...

If you choose to use this tech stack for one of your project, it would thus be useful to **point out which exact version of the stack it is using**. This would help you in many ways, like clearly designating the corresponding documentations and training materials your team members should use.

At last, the long term goal of this project is to improve and share the best practices, tools and ressources. It means that if you have any suggestion, problem or even will to participate, do not hesitate to fill issues or PR changes (better start a discussion before spending time on a PR).
